## Vimport - Virtual Container Share

### The Problem
As it currently stands, no individual or small business can place an order from a Chinese factory and receive wholesale prices.
Customers can order non-FCL (full container load) from online agents in China and are charged a massive premium. 
Most vendors do not communicate in English, and employing an English speaking agent just means you will pay too much.

The paperwork and legal knowledge required to import products from China is enough of a hurdle to put off most small businesses and sole traders from doing so.


### The Solution
Vimport connects customers and businesses that want to import non FCL orders directly from factories in China and
pay wholesale, trade prices.
It works by consolidating smaller orders from a group of customers into full-container loads.

Vimport simplifies importing by consolidating all tarrifs, taxes and freight costs into one initial payment. 

All customers are able to split the total order cost by the quantity they require, thereby receiving complete wholesale prices regardless of their order quantity. 

## Moodboard
I love all things maritime, so finding inspiration was easy. I decided I would use a multi-colour scheme inspired by shipping containers. I loved the birds-eye
view photos of ports. Since this app is based around container sharing, I chose one of these images for the home page.
